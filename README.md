# vscode-solution-explorer

This extension adds a Visual Studio Solution File explorer panel in Visual Studio Code. Now you can navigate into your solution following the original Visual Studio structure.

> *It was originally intended to work with .Net Core solutions and projects. And that is why support for other types of projects (such as .Net Framework or C++) is not guaranteed.*

If you want to enjoy the full experience, you should install:
- [.Net Core SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download) (dotnet command line is required)
- [Microsoft C# extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csharp) (aka Omnisharp)

## Getting Started

To activate `vscode-solution-explorer` you have to **first open a folder or workspace**.

Then, you can find this extension displayed as:

- a tab in the "Explorer" activity

![Visual Studio Code Explorer tab](https://github.com/fernandoescolar/vscode-solution-explorer/raw/main/images/vscode-solution-explorer-as-explorer-tab.gif)

- an activity with the Visual Studio icon

![Visual Studio Code Activity](https://github.com/fernandoescolar/vscode-solution-explorer/raw/main/images/vscode-solution-explorer-as-activity.gif)

You can configure it in the Visual Studio Code settings panel, looking for "VsSolution: **Show Mode**" section:

![Visual Studio Code Settings: Show Modes](https://github.com/fernandoescolar/vscode-solution-explorer/raw/main/images/vscode-solution-explorer-show-mode.png)

## Open Solutions

`vscode-solution-explorer` has several ways to open the solution files and you can configure them in the Visual Studio Code configuration panel.

### Open Solution command

You can execute the "Open solution" command from the command palette or from the welcome view (if no solution has been found).

![Open Solution Command](https://github.com/fernandoescolar/vscode-solution-explorer/raw/main/images/vscode-solution-explorer-open-command.png)

### Omnisharp integration

You can enable omnisharp integration and vscode-solution-explorer will open the same .sln file you open with Microsoft extension.

![Activate Omnisharp integration in settings panel](https://github.com/fernandoescolar/vscode-solution-explorer/raw/main/images/omnisharp-integration.png)

> It will ignore .csproj files because vscode-solution-explorer cannot open a project file without a Solution.

> You have to install [Microsoft C# extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csharp) to enable omnisharp integration.

### Find Solution files

You can use the automatic solution file finder activating some options in the Visual Studio Code settings panel.

![Open Solution Command](https://github.com/fernandoescolar/vscode-solution-explorer/raw/main/images/search-in-root-folder.png)

The `vssolution.openSolutions.inRootFolder` setting will look for the solution files in the root folder.

![inRootFolder](https://github.com/fernandoescolar/vscode-solution-explorer/raw/main/images/search-in-root-folder-recursive.png)

The `vssolution.openSolutions.inFoldersAndSubfolders` setting will search for the solution files in the root folder and its subfolders.

![inFoldersAndSubfolders](https://github.com/fernandoescolar/vscode-solution-explorer/raw/main/images/search-in-alt-folders.png)

And if you want to specify the subfolders where you want to look for the solution files you have to activate the `vssolution.openSolutions.inAltFolders` setting and specify the folders in the `vssolution.altSolutionFolders` setting:

![inAltFolders](https://github.com/fernandoescolar/vscode-solution-explorer/raw/main/images/vscode-solution-explorer-alt-folders.png)


*You can combine all of these options to find the best configuration for you.*

## Features

Adds a Solution Explorer panel where you can find a Visual Studio Solution File Explorer:

### Run dotnet commands in solutions and projects

Only available when the project is of kind CPS (dotnet core).

- Build: `dotnet build`
- Clean: `dotnet clean`
- New: `dotnet new`
- Pack: `dotnet pack`
- Publish: `dotnet publish`
- Restore: `dotnet restore`
- Run: `dotnet run`
- Watch: `dotnet watch run`

![Run dotnet commands in solutions and projects](https://github.com/fernandoescolar/vscode-solution-explorer/raw/main/images/vscode-solution-explorer-dotnet-commands.gif)

If you want to customize the terminal commands you can change them in the settings json file. These are the default commands configuration:

```json
{
  "vssolution.customCommands": {
    "addPackageReferenceToProject": [ "dotnet", "add", "\"$projectPath\"", "package", "\"$packageId\"" ],
    "addPackageReferenceToProjectWithVersion": [ "dotnet", "add", "\"$projectPath\"", "package", "\"$packageId\"", "-v", "\"$packageVersion\"" ],
    "addProjectReferenceToProject": [ "dotnet", "add", "\"$projectPath\"", "reference", "\"$referencedprojectPath\"" ],
    "build": [ "dotnet", "build", "\"$projectPath\"" ],
    "clean": [ "dotnet", "clean", "\"$projectPath\"" ],
    "createProject": [ "dotnet", "new", "\"$projectType\"", "-lang", "\"$language\"", "-n", "\"$projectName\"", "-o", "\"$folderName\"" ],
    "createSolution": [ "dotnet", "new", "sln", "-n", "\"$solutionName\"" ],
    "pack": [ "dotnet", "pack", "\"$projectPath\"" ],
    "publish": [ "dotnet", "publish", "\"$projectPath\"" ],
    "removeProjectFromSolution": [ "dotnet", "sln", "\"$solutionPath\"", "remove", "\"$projectPath\"" ],
    "removePackageReferenceFromProject": [ "dotnet", "remove", "\"$projectPath\"", "package", "\"$packageId\"" ],
    "removeProjectReferenceFromProject": [ "dotnet", "remove", "\"$projectPath\"", "reference", "\"$referencedprojectPath\"" ],
    "restore": [ "dotnet", "restore", "\"$projectPath\"" ],
    "run": [ "dotnet", "run", "--project", "\"$projectPath\"" ],
    "test": [ "dotnet", "test", "\"$projectPath\"" ],
    "watch": [ "dotnet", "watch", "run", "--project", "\"$projectPath\"" ]
  }
}
```

It will replace keywords like `$solutionPath` or `$projectPath` with the actual values.

As an example, if you want to compile in `Release` mode everytime you publish a project you can create somethink like:

```json
{
  "vssolution.customCommands":  {
    "publish": [ "dotnet", "publish", "\"$projectPath\"", "-c", "Release" ]
  }
}
```

### Drag and drop files, folders and projects

![Drag and drop files, folders and projects](https://github.com/fernandoescolar/vscode-solution-explorer/raw/main/images/vscode-solution-explorer-drag-and-drop.gif)


### Create, delete, rename or project folders and files

![Create, delete, rename or project folders and files](https://github.com/fernandoescolar/vscode-solution-explorer/raw/main/images/vscode-solution-explorer-project-files.gif)

### Create, delete, rename or move solution, solution folders and projects

![Create, delete, rename or move solution, solution folders and projects](https://github.com/fernandoescolar/vscode-solution-explorer/raw/main/images/vscode-solution-explorer-solution-files.gif)

### Add or remove nuget packages

Only available when the project is of kind CPS (dotnet core).

![Add or remove nuget packages](https://github.com/fernandoescolar/vscode-solution-explorer/raw/main/images/vscode-solution-explorer-package-references.gif)

If you want to use custom nuget feeds it will look for a file called `nuget.config` in the root folder of the project and its parent folders. If it finds this file, it will read the configuration and use it. If it does not find it, it will use the default nuget feed.

As an Example:

```xml
<configuration>
  <packageSources>
    <add key="Nuget.org" value="https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json" />
    <add key="PrivateFeed" value="https://mydomain.com/myfeed/index.json" />
  </packageSources>
  <packageSourceCredentials>
	  <PrivateFeed>
	    <add key="Username" value="me@email.com" />
      <add key="ClearTextPassword" value="my_super_strong_password" />
	  </PrivateFeed>
  </packageSourceCredentials>
</configuration>
```

If you are working with `/drive/path/to/project.csproj`, it will look for:
- `/drive/path/to/nuget.config`
- `/drive/path/nuget.config`
- `/drivenuget.config`
- `/nuget.config`

> Note vscode-solution-explorer only supports ClearTextPassword credencials in nuget.config

### Update all nuget packages versions

Only available when the project is of kind CPS (dotnet core).

![Update all nuget packages versions](https://github.com/fernandoescolar/vscode-solution-explorer/raw/main/images/vscode-solution-explorer-update-packages-versions.gif)

### Add or remove project references

Only available when the project is of kind CPS (dotnet core).

![Add or remove project references](https://github.com/fernandoescolar/vscode-solution-explorer/raw/main/images/vscode-solution-explorer-project-references.gif)

### Create file templates

This extensions has a custom template system to create new files. When you create a new file you can select a template from the dropdown list:

![Open Solution Command](https://github.com/fernandoescolar/vscode-solution-explorer/raw/main/images/vscode-solution-explorer-new-file.gif)

You can customize the templates for your project. First of all click with the right mouse button on your solution file and select `Install File Creation Templates`. Then you have to move to `.vscode/solution-explorer` folder and you can find the file called `template-list.json`. This file contains the list of templates.

We strongly recommend you to update your templates after updating this extension:
